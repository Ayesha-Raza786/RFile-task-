This project explores the relationship between international tourism arrivals and economic growth across multiple countries from 1995 to 2022.
The data combines official statistics from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators (WDI).
The main objective is to evaluate how tourism activity influences national economic growth using panel data econometric models.
